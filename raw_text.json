Definition\nPollution is an undesirable change in\nphysical, chemical and biological\ncharacteristics of our land, air or water\ncaused by excessive accumulation of\npollutants (i.e. Substances which cause\npollution).\nKINDS OF POLLUTION\nThe pollution is of four major types namely\nair pollution, water pollution, land\npollution and noise pollution.\nIn terms of origin it may be natural or\nanthropogenic (man-made).\nPOLLUTION\n Degradation of air quality and natural\natmospheric condition constitute air\npollution. The air pollutant may be a gas or\nparticulate matter.\nAir pollutants and their effects\nParticulate matter \u2013 it comprises of small\nsuspended particles such as soot, dust, pesticides,\netc., and biological agents such as spores, pollen\nand dust mites. It causes respiratory ailments such\nas asthma, chronic bronchitis, etc.,\nCarbon monoxide \u2013 is a product of incomplete\ncombustion of fossil fuels in automobiles. It is\nhighly poisonous to most animals. When inhaled,\ncarbon monoxide reduces the oxygen carrying\ncapacity of blood.AIR POLLUTION\n Hydrocarbons \u2013 hydrocarbons such as methane,\nare evolved from soil microbes (methanogens) in\nflooded rice fields and swamps. They are also\ngenerated during the burning of coal and petroleum\nproducts.\nSulphur dioxide \u2013 is released from oil refineries\nand ore smelters which use the sulphur containing\nfuels. It causes harmful effects on plants and animals.\nIt causes chlorosis (loss of chlorophyll) and necrosis\n(localised death of tissues). In human, it causes health\nproblems such as asthma, bronchitis and emphysema.\nNitrogen oxides \u2013 It causes reddish brown haze\n(brown air) in traffic congested city air which\ncontributes to heart and lung problems.Air pollutants and their effects\n Photochemical smog \u2013Smog is a mixture of\nsmoke and fog. It is formed in the atmosphere\nunder the influence of sunlight by the\nphotochemical reactions of hydrocarbons, oxides\nof nitrogen and oxygen, resulting in the formation\no fP A N( Peroxy Acetyl Nitrate ).\nPAN damages the chlorophyll and thus reduces\nphotosynthesis and growth. It also causes acute\nirritation of eyes and throat. Visibility of the\nsurrounding is reduced due to smog.\nAcid rain \u2013 gases such as Sulphur di oxide and\nNitrogen oxides are oxidized to form sulphuric and\nnitric acids along with water, and precipitate as\nacid rain. It damages building materials, plants and\nanimals. It also makes the soil acidic.Secondary effects of air pollution\n 1. The particulates emitted by industries should\nbe controlled by devices such as scrubbers,\nprecipitators and filters.\n2. Use of unleaded or low sulphur fuel is to be\nencouraged.\n3. Shifting to non-conventional sources of\nenergy (e.g solar energy, hydel energy, tidal\nenergy, etc.,) in order to reduce the\ndependance of conventional sources.\n4. Smoking in public places should be\nprohibited, because the cigarette smoke\ncontains carcinogens such as benzopyrene.\nAn average smoker runs the risk of\ndeveloping heart and lung diseases.\n5. Planting of trees along the road sides and\naround industrial areas.Control of air pollution\n Water pollution is defined as the\nadding of unwanted substances or\nthe change of physical and\nchemical characteristics of water in\nany way which makes it unfit for\nhuman consumption.\nIt is caused by waste products of\nindustries (effluents), domestic\nsewage, oil spillage, agricultural\nand industrial run off etc.,WATER POLLUTION\n Industrial wastes \u2013The industrial\neffluents containing heavy metals\nand chemicals such as arsenic,\ncadmium, copper, chromium,\nmercury, zinc, nickel, etc,. are\ndirectly released into the water\nbodies such as lakes, ponds and\nrivers without proper treatment.\nThese wastes contaminate the water\nbodies and make them unsuitable\nfor human consumption.\nHot water is another noted pollutant\nfrom industries.\nSources and effects of water pollution 1. Many industries use water as a coolant\nfor the machinery and release of hot\nwaste water into the water bodies\ncausing thermal pollution which affect\nboth the plant and animal life.\n2. The surface run off - the surface run off\nfrom agricultural land is contaminated\nwith pesticides and residues of inorganic\nfertilizers.\n3. The run off from urban and industrial\nare rich in organic and inorganic\ncompounds. These pollutants\ncontaminate both surface and ground\nwater resources.Sources and effects of water pollution..\n 4. Oil spills \u2013 An oil spill is an accidental\ndischarge of petroleum products in oceans\nand estuaries from capsized oil tankers,\noffshore drilling and exploration operations.\nIt can cause drastic damage to the marine\nand coastal bio diversity.\n5. Domestic Sewage \u2013 It is rich in organic\nmatter and detergents. Decomposition of\norganic matter increases the nutrient\ncontent of the water bodies.\n6. Availability of excess nutrients results in\nalgal bloom on the surface of water\nresulting in the deficiency of oxygen content\n(BOD \u2013 Biological Oxygen Demand). This in\nturn leads to the death of aquatic\norganisms. This process is known as\nEutrophication.Sources and effects of water pollution...\n 1. Sewage treatment plants should be\ninstalled to treat sewage before\nreleasing into water bodies.\n2. Excessive use of pesticides, herbicides\nand fertilizers should be avoided.\n3. Biological control of insect pests and\norganic farming is to be followed in\norder to reduce the dependence on\npesticides and inorganic fertilizers.\n4. By legislation and strict enforcement.\n5. By creating social awareness among\npeople about the water pollution and\nthe need for pure water.Control of water pollution\n Soil pollution is the\nunfavorable alteration of soil\nby the addition or removal of\nsubstances which decrease\nsoil productivity and ground\nwater quality.\nIt usually results from\ndifferent human activities like\ndumping of waste, use of agro\nchemicals, mining operations\nand urbanization .SOIL POLLUTION\n \u007fThe industrial solid waste and sludge\ncontain toxic organic and inorganic\ncompounds as well as heavy metals.\n\u007fThe radio active waste from nuclear power\nplants and nuclear explosions also\ncontaminate the soil.\n\u007fFly ash contains fine particulates which are\nreleased from thermal power plants. It\nsettle on the ground and cause pollution.\n\u007fThe domestic waste is rich in organic\nmatter and undergo decomposition.\n\u007fThe hospital waste contains a variety of\npathogens that can seriously affect human\nhealth.SOIL POLLUTION : Causes and effects\n Agricultural chemicals such as\npesticides, insecticides and\ninorganic fertilizers may pollute\ndrinking water and can change\nthe chemical properties of the\nsoil adversely affecting the soil\norganisms.SOIL POLLUTION : Causes and effects\n \u007fManagement of soil wastes include\ncollection and categorization of wastes.\nRecovery of resources like scrap metals,\nplastics, etc., for recycling and reuse and\nsafe disposal with a minimum\nenvironmental hazards is to be followed.\n\u007fOther notable methods of waste disposal\ninclude incineration (burning in the\npresence of oxygen) and pyrolysis\n(burning in the absence of oxygen).\n\u007fAfforestation and reforestation should be\nundertaken on a large scale to prevent\nsoil erosion and loss of soil nutrients.CONTROL OF SOIL POLLUTION\n The emission of protons, electrons\nand electromagnetic radiations\nreleased by the disintegration of\nradioactive substances such as\nradium, thorium, uranium, etc,. cause\nair, water and land pollution.\nEffects :-\n\u007fThe ionising radiations can cause\nmutations.\n\u007fStrontium-90 accumulates in bones\ncausing bone cancer.\n\u007fIodine-131 can damage bone\nmarrow, spleen, lymph nodes and\ncan cause leukemia (blood cancer).\nRADIOACTIVE POLLUTION \u007fCare should be taken to prevent\nthe leakage of radioactive\nsubstances from nuclear\nreactors.\n\u007fRadioactive wastes should be\ndisposed off safely.\n\u007fStrict measures should be\nfollowed in the construction\nand maintenance of nuclear\npower plants to prevent nuclear\naccidents.\n\u007fControl or prevention of nuclear\ntests.\nRADIOACTIVE POLLUTION : PREVENTIVE MEASURES\n \u007fNoise may be defined as an\nunwanted and unpleasant\nsound that may have\nadverse effects on animals\nand humans.\n\u007fThe unit of sound level is\ndecibels (db).\n\u007fNoise level above 120 db is\nconsidered harmful to\nhuman beings.\nNOISE POLLUTION\n Sources\n\u007fThe different sources associated with\nnoise pollution are industrial machinery,\nroad, rail and air transport,\nloudspeakers, construction equipments,\nhousehold appliances, crackers, etc,.\nEffects\n\u007fNoise seriously affects heartbeat,\nbreathing, and can cause constriction of\nblood vessels.\n\u007fIt can cause headache, sleeplessness,\nirritability and may seriously affect the\nproductive performance of human.NOISE POLLUTION..\n \u007fLoud noises (above 130 db) can cause damage to the\near drum, hair cells of cochlea (organ of hearing) and\nthereby resulting in temperory or permanent loss of\nhearing.\n\u007fIt can also seriously affect the concentration of students\nwhile learning.NOISE POLLUTION\u2026\n \u007fThe industries should be established\naway from residential areas.\n\u007fTrees should be planted along roadside\nor highways to reduce noise levels.\n\u007fThe industrial machinery and motor\nvehicles should be properly maintained\nin order to minimize the noise.\n\u007fThe use of loudspeakers and bursting\nof crackers should be restricted.\n\u007fEffort must be made to create\nawareness among people about the\nharmful effects of noise and the need\nto control it.NOISE POLLUTION: Control measures\n \u007fIndia produces 55 million tons of municipal solid waste annually at\npresent.\n\u007fPer capita generation of waste varies from 200 gm to 600 gm per\ncapita / day.\n\u007fAverage generation rate at 0.4 kg per capita per day in towns.\n\u007fCollection efficiency ranges between 50% to 90% of the solid waste\nare generated.Waste Generation in India\n \u007fSolid or semi-solid material (including\ngases and liquids in containers) which\nare non soluble in nature are solid\nwaste.\n\u007fSolid waste includes agricultural\nrefuse, demolition waste, industrial\nwaste, mining residues, municipal\ngarbage, sewage sludge, etc.WHAT IS SOLID

others)\nNon-biodegradable : cannot be\ndegraded plastics, bottles, old-\nmachines, containers and others) TYPES OF SOLID WASTE\n\u007fSolid waste can be classified into different\ntypes depending on their source:\n\u007fHousehold waste or municipal waste :\nincludes food, paper, cardboard, plastic,\ntextiles, leather, glass, metal, ashes,\nelectronics waste etc.\n\u007fIndustrial waste :includes toxic chemicals,\noil, debris from construction site,\npackaging waste, ashes etc.\n\u007fBiomedical waste or hospital waste :\nmedicine bottles, expired medicines,\nsyringes, medical instruments such as\nscissors, blades etc.\n Agricultural waste :includes pesticides,\ncrops, water coming from the fields also\nconsists of small amount of toxic chemicals .\nNuclear waste : includes radioactive\nsubstances coming from reactors, fuel\n(uranium, thorium, plutonium etc). Its\nhighly dangerous and requires proper\ndisposal.\nHazardous waste :includes toxic chemical,\nacids, corrosive, ignitable and reactive\nmaterials, gases etc.TYPES OF SOLID WASTE\n SOLID WASTE COMPOSITION\n \u007fPer capita waste generation\nincreasing by 1.3% per annum\n\u007fWith urban population increasing\nbetween 3 \u2013 3.5% per annum\n\u007fYearly increase in waste generation is\naround 5% annually India produces\n42.0 million tons of municipal solid\nwaste annually at present.\n\u007fPer capita generation of waste varies\nfrom 200 gm to 600 gm per capita /\nday.\n\u007fCollection efficiency ranges between\n50% to 90% of the solid waste\ngenerated.MAGNITUDE OF PROBLEM\n \u007f30% -

Untreated or improperly\ntreated waste is a major cause of pollution of rivers and environmental degradation causing\nill health and loss of crop productivity . In this lesson you will study about the major causes\nof pollution, their effects on our environment and the various measures that can be taken to\ncontrol such pollutions.\n OBJECTIVES\nAfter completing this lesson, you will be able to:\n\u2022define the terms pollution and pollutants;\n\u2022list various kinds of pollution;\n\u2022describe types of pollution, sour ces, harmful effects on human health and contr ol\nof air pollution, indoor air pollution, noise pollution;\n\u2022describe water pollution, its causes and contr ol;\n\u2022describe thermal pollution;\n\u2022describe soil pollution, its causes and contr ol;\n\u2022describe radiation pollution, sour ces and hazar ds.\n 10.1 POLLUTION AND POLLUT ANTS\nHuman activities directly or indirectly af fect the environment adversely . A stone crusher\nadds a lot of suspended particulate matter and noise into the atmosphere. Automobiles\nemit from their tail pipes oxides of nitrogen, sulphur dioxide, carbon dioxide, carbon\nmonoxide and a complex mixture of unburnt hydrocarbons and black soot which pollute\nthe atmosphere. Domestic sewage and run off from agricultural fields, laden with pesticides 165Environmental Pollution\nNotesMODULE - 4\nContemporary\nEnvironmental Issuesand fertilizers, pollute water bodies. Effluents from tanneries contain many harmful chemicals\nand emit foul smell. These are only a few examples which show how human activities\npollute the environment. Pollution  may be defined as addition of undesirable material into\nthe environment as a result of human activities. The agents which cause environmental\npollution are called pollutants . A pollutants may be defined as a physical, chemical or\nbiological substance unintentionally released into the environment which is directly or\nindirectly harmful to humans and other living organisms.\n 10.2 TYPES OF POLLUTION\nPollution may be of the following types:\n\u2022Air pollution\n\u2022Noise pollution\n\u2022Water pollution\n\u2022Soil pollution\n\u2022Thermal pollution\n\u2022Radiation pollution\n 10.3 AIR POLLUTION\nAir pollution is a result of industrial and certain domestic activity . An ever increasing use of\nfossil fuels in power plants, industries, transportation, mining, construction of buildings,\nstone quarries had led to air pollution. Air pollution may be defined as the presence of\nany solid, liquid or gaseous substance including noise and radioactive radiation in the\natmosphere in such concentration that may be directly and indirectly injurious to humans\nor other living organisms, plants, property or interferes with the normal environmental\nprocesses. Air pollutants are of two types (1) suspended particulate matter , and (2) gaseous\npollutants like carbon dioxide (CO2), NOx etc. Some of the major air pollutants, their\nsources and effects are given in table 10.1.\nTable 10.1: Particulate air pollutants, their sour ces and effects\nPollutant Sources Effects\nSuspended particulate Smoke from domestic, Depends on specific composition\nmatter/dust industrial and vehicular soot Reduces sunlight and visibility ,\nincreases corrosion, Pneumoconiosis,\nasthma,  cancer , and other lung diseases.\nFly ash Part of smoke released from Settles down on vegetation, houses.

Leachates contain harmful\nmaterial Environmental Science Senior Secondary Course\nNotes\n166MODULE - 4\nContemporary\nEnvironmental Issues10.3.1 Particulate pollutants\nParticulate matter suspended in air are dust and soot released from the industrial chimneys.\nTheir size ranges from 0.001 to 500 \u00b5m in diameter . Particles less than 10\u00b5m float and\nmove freely with the air current. Particles which are more than 10\u00b5m in diameter settle\ndown. Particles less than 0.02 \u00b5m form persisent aerosols. Major source of SPM (suspended\nparticulate matter) are vehicles, power plants, construction activities, oil refinery , railway\nyard, market place, industries, etc.\n\u2022 Fly ash\nFly ash is ejected mostly by thermal power plants as by products of coal burning operations.\nFly ash pollutes air and water and may cause heavy metal pollution in water bodies. Fly\nash affects vegetation as a result of its direct deposition on leaf surfaces or indirectly\nthrough its deposition on soil. Fly ash is now being used for making bricks and as a land fill\nmaterial.\n\u2022 Lead and other metals particles\nTetraethyl lead (TEL) is used as an anti-knock agent in petrol for smooth and easy running\nof vehicles. The lead particles coming out from the exhaust pipes of vehicles is mixed with\nair. If inhaled it produces injurious ef fects on kidney and liver and interferes with development\nof red blood cells. Lead mixed with water and food can create cumulative poisoning. It\nhas long term effects on children as it lowers intelligence.\nOxides of iron, aluminum, manganese, magnesium, zinc and other metals have adverse\neffect due to deposition of dust on plants during mining operations and metallurgical\nprocesses. They create physiological, biochemical and developmental disorders in plants\nand also contribute towards reproductive failure in plants.\nTable 10.2:  Annual average concentration of pollutants in ambient air in\nresidential and industrial ar eas (year 2000) mg/m3 in 24 hours\nSPM permissible- residential 140 \u2013 200 mg/m3, industrial 360 \u2013 500 mg/m3\nCity Residential area Industrial area\nAgra 349 388\nBhopal 185 160\nDelhi 368 372\nKanpur 348 444\nKolkata 218 405\nNagpur 140 157 167Environmental Pollution\nNotesMODULE - 4\nContemporary\nEnvironmental Issues10.3.2 Gaseous pollutants\nPower plants, industries, different types of vehicles \u2013 both private and commercial use\npetrol, diesel as fuel and release gaseous pollutants  such as carbon dioxide, oxides of\nnitrogen and sulphur dioxide along with particulate matter in the form of smoke.

In hospitals, pathogens\npresent in waste remain in the air in the form of spores. This can result in hospital acquired\ninfections and is an occupational health hazard. In congested areas, slums and rural areas\nburning of firewood and biomass results in lot of smoke. Children and ladies exposed to\nsmoke may suffer from acute respiratory problems which include running nose, cough,\nsore throat, lung infection, asthama, difficulty in breathing, noisy respiration and wheezing.\n(ii) Prevention and control of indoor air pollution\nUse of wood and dung cakes should be replaced by cleaner fuels such as biogas, kerosene\nor electricity . But supply of electricity is limited. Similarly kerosene is also limited. Improved\nstoves for looking like smokeless chullahs have high thermal efficiency and reduced emission\nof pollutants including smoke. The house designs should incorporate a well ventilated\nkitchen. Use of biogas and CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) need to be encouraged.\nThose species of trees such as baval ( Acacia nilotica ) which are least smoky should be\nplanted and used. Charcoal is a comparatively cleaner fuel. Indoor pollution due to decay\nof exposed kitchen waste can be reduced by covering the waste properly . Segregation of\nwaste, pretreatment at source, sterilization of rooms will help in checking indoor air pollution.\n(iii) Prevention and control of industrial pollution\nIndustrial pollution can be greatly reduced by:\n(a)use of cleaner fuels such as liquefied natural gas (LNG) in power plants, fertilizer\nplants etc. which is cheaper in addition to being environmentally friendly .\n(b)employing environment friendly industrial processes so that emission of pollutants and\nhazardous waste is minimized.\n(c)installing devices which reduce release of pollutants. Devices like filters, electrostatic\nprecipitators, inertial collectors, scrubbers, gravel bed filters or dry scrubbers are\ndescribed below:\n(i)Filters  \u2013 Filters remove particulate matter from the gas stream. The medium of a filter\nmay be made of fibrous materials like cloth, granular material like sand, a rigid material\nlike screen, or any mat like felt pad. Baghouse filtration system is the most common\none and is made of cotton or synthetic fibres ( for low temperatures) or glass cloth\nfabrics (for higher temperature up to 290oC).\n(ii)Electrostatic precipitators (ESP)-  The emanating dust is charged with ions and the\nionized particulate matter is collected on an oppositely charged surface. The particles 169Environmental Pollution\nNotesMODULE - 4\nContemporary\nEnvironmental Issuesare removed from the collection surface by occasional shaking or by rapping the\nsurface. ESPs are used in boilers, furnaces, and many other units of thermal power\nplants, cement factories, steel plants, etc.\n(iii)Inertial collectors \u2013  It works on the principle that inertia of SPM in a gas is higher\nthan its solvent and as inertia is a function of the mass of the particulate matter this\ndevice collects heavier particles more ef ficiently . \u2018Cyclone\u2019  is a common inertial collector\nused in gas cleaning plants.\n(iv)Scrubbers  \u2013 Scrubbers are wet collectors. They remove aerosols from a stream of\ngas either by collecting wet particles on a surface followed by their removal, or else\nthe particles are wetted by a scrubbing liquid. The particles get trapped as they travel\nfrom supporting gaseous medium across the interface to the liquid scrubbing medium.\nGaseous pollutants can be removed by absorption in a liquid using a wet scrubber and\ndepends on the type of the gas to be removed e.g. for removal of sulphur dioxide alkaline\nsolution is needed as it dissolves sulphur dioxide. Gaseous pollutants may be absorbed on\nan activated solid surface like silica gel, alumina, carbon, etc. Silica gel can remove water\nvapour . Condensation allows the recovery of many by products in coal and petroleum\nprocessing industries from their liquid effluents.\nApart from the use of above mentioned devices, other control measures are-\n\u2022increasing the height of chimneys.\n\u2022closing industries which pollute the environment.\n\u2022shifting of polluting industries away from cities and heavily populated areas.\n\u2022development and maintenance of green belt of adequate width.\n(iv) Control of vehicular pollution\n\u2022The emission standards for automobiles have been set which if followed will reduce\nthe pollution. Standards have been set for the durability of catalytic converters which\nreduce vehicular emission.\n\u2022In cities like Delhi, motor vehicles need to obtain Pollution Under Control (PUC)\ncertificate at regular intervals. This ensures that levels of pollutants emitted from vehicle\nexhaust are not beyond the prescribed legal limits.\n\u2022The price of diesel is much cheaper than petrol which promotes use of diesel. To\nreduce emission of sulphurdioxide, sulphur content in diesel has been reduced to 0.05%.\n\u2022Earlier lead in the form of tetraethyl lead was added in the petrol to raise octane level\nfor smooth running of engines. Addition of lead in petrol has been banned to prevent\nemission of lead particles with the vehicular emission.

Chlorine from chemicals such as\nchlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) used for refrigeration, air conditioning, fire extinguishers,\ncleaning solvents, aerosols (spray cans of perfumes, medicine, insecticide) cause damage\nto ozone layer chlorine contained in the CFCs on reaching the  ozone (O3) layer split the\nozone molecules to form oxygen (O2). Amount of ozone, thus gets reduced and cannot\nprevent the entry of UV radiation. There has been a reduction of ozone umbrella or shield\nover the Arctic and Antarctic regions. This is known as ozone hole . This permits passage\nof UV radiation on earth\u2019 s atmosphere which causes sunburn, cataract in eyes leading to\nblindness, skin cancer , reduced productivity of forests, etc. Under the \u201cMontreal Protocol\u201d\namended in 1990 it was decided to completely phase out CFCs to prevent damage of\nozone layer .\n 10.5 GLOBAL  WARMING  AND GREENHOUSE EFFECT\nAtmospheric gases like carbondioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, water vapour , and\nchlorofluorocarbons are capable of trapping the out-going infrared radiation from the earth.\nInfra-red radiations trapped by the earth\u2019 s surface cannot pass through these gases and to\nincrease thermal energy or heat in the atmosphere. Thus, the temperature of the global\natmosphere is increased. As this phenomenon of increase in temperature is observed in 171Environmental Pollution\nNotesMODULE - 4\nContemporary\nEnvironmental Issuesgreen houses, in the botanical gardens these gases are known as green house gases and\nthe heating effect is known as green house effect. If greenhouse gases are not checked, by\nthe turn of the century the temperature may rise by 50C. This will melt the polar ice caps\nand increase the sea level leading to coastal flooding, loss of coastal areas and ecosystems\nlike swamps and marshes, etc.\n 10.6 NOISE POLLUTION\nNoise is one of the most pervasive pollutant. A musical clock may be nice to listen during\nthe day , but may be an irritant during sleep at night. Noise by definition is \u201csound without\nvalue\u201d or \u201cany noise that is unwanted by the recipient\u201d. Noise in industries such as stone\ncutting and crushing, steel forgings , loudspeakers, shouting by hawkers selling their wares,\nmovement of heavy transport vehicles, railways and airports leads to irritation and an\nincreased blood pressure, loss of temper , decrease in work ef ficiency , loss of hearing\nwhich may be first temporary but can become permanent in the noise stress continues. It is\ntherefore of utmost importance that excessive noise is controlled. Noise level is measured\nin terms of decibels (dB). W.H.O. (W orld Health Or ganization) has prescribed optimum\nnoise level as 45 dB by day and 35 dB by night. Anything above 80 dB is hazardous. The\ntable10.4 gives the noise intensity in some of the common activities.\nTable 10.4: Sources of some noises and their intensity\nSource Intensity Source Intensity\nQuiet Conversation 20-30dB Radio Music  50-60 dB\nLoud Conversation 60 dB Traffic Noise 60-90 dB\nLawn Mower 60-80 dB Heavy Truck 90-100 dB\nAircraft Noise 90-120 dB Space Vehicle 140-179 dB\nBeat Music 120 dB Launch\nMotor Cycle 105 dB Jet Engine 140 dB\n10.6.1 Sources of noise pollution\nNoise pollution is a growing problem. All human activities contribute to noise pollution to\nvarying extent. Sources of noise pollution are many and may be located indoors or outdoors.\nIndoor sources  include noise produced by radio, television, generators, electric fans, air\ncoolers, air conditioners, different home appliances, and family conflict. Noise pollution is\nmore in cities due to a higher concentration of population and industries and activities such\nas transportation. Noise like other pollutants is a by product of industrialization, urbanization\nand modern civilization. Environmental Science Senior Secondary Course\nNotes\n172MODULE - 4\nContemporary\nEnvironmental IssuesOutdoor sources  of noise pollution include indiscriminate use of loudspeakers, industrial\nactivities, automobiles, rail traffic, aeroplanes and activities such as those at market place,\nreligious, social, and cultural functions, sports and political rallies. In rural areas farm\nmachines, pump sets are main sources of noise pollution. During festivals, marriage and\nmany other occasions, use of fire crackers contribute to noise pollution.\n10.6.2 Effects of noise pollution\nNoise pollution is highly annoying and irritating. Noise disturbs sleep, causes hypertension\n(high blood pressure), emotional problems such as aggression, mental depression and\nannoyance. Noise pollution adversely affects efficiency and performance of individuals.\n10.6.3 Prevention and control of noise pollution\nFollowing steps can be taken to control or minimize noise pollution-\n\u2022Road traffic noise can be reduced by better designing and proper maintenance of\nvehicles.\n\u2022Noise abatement measures include creating noise mounds, noise attenuation walls and\nwell maintained roads and smooth surfacing of roads.\n\u2022Retrofitting of locomotives, continuously welded rail track, use of electric locomotives\nor deployment of quieter rolling stock will reduce noises emanating from trains.\n\u2022Air traffic noise can be reduced by appropriate insulation and introduction of noise\nregulations for take off and landing of aircrafts at the airport.\n\u2022Industrial noises can be reduced by sound proofing equipment like generators and\nareas producing lot of noise.\n\u2022Power tools, very loud music and land movers, public functions using loudspeakers,\netc should not be permitted at night. Use of horns, alarms, refrigeration units, etc. is to\nbe restricted. Use of fire crackers which are noisy and cause air pollution should be\nrestricted.\n\u2022A green belt of trees is an ef ficient noise absorber .\n INTEXT QUESTIONS 10.2\n1.What is noise and in which units it is measured?\n______________________________________________________________\n2.State two harmful effects of noise pollution.\n______________________________________________________________\n3.State two important indoor and two outdoor sources of noise pollution?

Water pollution is\ncaused by a variety of human activities such as industrial, agricultural and domestic.\nAgricultural run off laden with excess fertilizers and pesticides, industrial effluents with\ntoxic substances and sewage water with human and animal wastes pollute our water\nthoroughly . Natural sources of pollution of water are soil erosion, leaching of minerals\nfrom rocks and decaying of or ganic matter . Rivers, lakes, seas, oceans, estuaries and\nground water sources may be polluted by point or non-point sources. When pollutants are\ndischarged from a specific location such as a drain pipe  carrying industrial effluents\ndischarged directly into a water body it represents point source pollution.  In contrast\nnon-point sources include discharge of pollutants from diffused sources or from a larger\narea such as run off from agricultural fields, grazing lands, construction sites, abandoned\nmines and pits, roads and streets.\n10.7.1 Sources of water pollution\nWater pollution is the major source of water born diseases and other health problems.\nSediments brought by runoff water from agricultural fields and discharge of untreated or\npartially treated sewage and industrial effluents, disposal of fly ash or solid waste into or\nclose to a water body cause severe problems of water pollution. Increased turbidity of\nwater because of sediments reduces penetration of light in water that reduces photosynthesis\nby aquatic plants.\n(i) Pollution due to pesticides and inorganic chemicals\n\u2022Pesticides like DDT and others used in agriculture may contaminate water bodies.\nAquatic organisms take up pesticides from water get into the food chain (aquatic in\nthis case) and move up the food chain. At higher trophic level they get concentrated\nand may reach the upper end of the food chain.\n\u2022Metals like lead, zinc, arsenic, copper , mercury and cadmium in industrial waste waters\nadversely af fect humans and other animals. Arsenic pollution of ground water has\nbeen reported from West Bengal, Orissa, Bihar , Western U.P . Consumption of such\narsenic polluted water leads to accumulation of arsenic in the body parts like blood,\nnails and hairs causing skin lesions, rough skin, dry and thickening of skin and ultimately\nskin cancer .\n\u2022Pollution of water bodies by mercury causes Minamata disease  in humans and\ndropsy  in fishes. Lead causes displexia , cadmium poisoning causes Itai \u2013 Itai disease\netc.\n\u2022Oil pollution of sea occurs from leakage from ships, oil tankers, rigs and pipelines.\nAccidents of oil tankers spill large quantity of oil in seas which kills marine birds and\nadversely affects other marine life and beaches. Environmental Science Senior Secondary Course\nNotes\n174MODULE - 4\nContemporary\nEnvironmental Issues\n(ii) Thermal pollution\nPower plants- thermal and nuclear , chemical and other industries use lot of water (about\n30 % of all abstracted water) for cooling purposes and the used hot water is discharged\ninto rivers, streams or oceans. The waste heat from the boilers and heating processes\nincreases the temperature of the cooling water . Dischar ge of hot water may increase the\ntemperature of the receiving water by 10 to 15 \u00b0C above the ambient water temperature.\nThis is thermal pollution . Increase in water temperature decreases dissolved oxygen in\nwater which adversely affects aquatic life. Unlike terrestrial ecosystems, the temperature\nof water bodies remain steady and does not change very much. Accordingly , aquatic\norganisms are adopted to a uniform steady temperature of environment and any fluctuation\nin water temperature severely affects aquatic plants and animals. Hence discharge of hot\nwater from power plants adversely af fects aquatic or ganisms. Aquatic plants and animals\nin the warm tropical water live dangerously close to their upper limit of temperature,\nparticularly during the warm summer months. It requires only a slight deviation from this\nlimit to cause a thermal stress to these organisms.\nDischarge of hot water in water body  affects feeding in fishes, increases their metabolism\nand affects their growth. Their swimming efficiency declines. Running away from predators\nor chasing prey becomes difficult. Their resistance to diseases and parasites decreases.\nDue to thermal pollution biological diversity is reduced. One of the best methods of reducing\nthermal pollution is to store the hot water in cooling ponds, allow the water to cool before\nreleasing into any receiving water body\n10.7.2 Ground water pollution\nLot of people around the world depend on ground water for drinking, domestic, industrial\nand agricultural uses. Generally groundwater is a clean source of water . However , human\nactivities such as improper sewage disposal, dumping of farm yard manures and agricultural\nchemicals, industrial ef fluents are causing pollution of ground water .\nFig. 10.2:  Figur e showing how the gr ound water gets polluted 175Environmental Pollution\nNotesMODULE - 4\nContemporary\nEnvironmental Issues10.7.3 Eutrophication\n\u2022 \u2018Eu\u2019 maens well or healthy and \u2018trophy\u2019 means nutrition. The enrichment of water bodies\nwith nutrients causes entrophication of the water body .\nDischarge of domestic waste, agricultural surface runoff, land drainage and industrial effluents\nin a water body leads to rapid nutrients enrichment in a water body . The excessive nutrient\nenrichment in a water body encourages the growth of algae duckweed, water hyacinth,\nphytoplankton and other aquatic plants.The biological demand for oxygen (BOD) increases\nwith the increase in aquatic or ganisms. As more plants grow and die, the dead and decaying\nplants and organic matter acted upon by heterotrophic prtozoans and bacteria, deplete the\nwater of dissolved oxygen (DO). Decrease in DO result in sudden death of large population\nof fish and other aquatic organisms including plants, releasing offensive smell and makes\nthe water unfit for human use. The sudden and explosive growth of phytoplankton and\nalgae impart green colour to the water is known as water bloom, or \u201calgal blooms\u201d. These\nphytoplankton release toxic substances in water that causes sudden death of large population\nof fishes. This phenomenon of nutrient enrichment of a water body is called eutrophication .\nHuman activities are mainly responsible for the eutrophication of a growing number of\nlakes and water bodies in the country\n10.7.4 Methods for control of water pollution and water recycling\nControl water pollution\nWaste water from domestic or industrial sources or from garbage dumps is generally\nknown as sewage.  It may also contain rain water and surface runoff. The sewage water\ncan be treated to make it safe for disposal into water bodies like rivers, lakes etc. The\ntreatment involves three stages: primary , secondary and tertiary . This includes 1.\nsedimentation, 2. coagulation/flocculation, 3.filtration, 4.disinfection, 5.softening and\n6.aeration. The first four steps are of primary treatment. The first three steps are involved\nin primary treatment remove suspended particulate matter . Secondary treatment removes\norganic solids, left out after primary treatment, through their microbial decomposition.\nEffluents after secondary treatment may be clean but contain large amounts of nitrogen, in\nform of ammonia, nitrates and phosphorous which can cause problem of eutrophication\nupon their dischar ge into a receiving water body such as river , lake or pond. The tertiary\ntreatment is meant to remove nutrients, disinfect for removing pathogenic bacteria, and\naeration removes hydrogen sulphide and reduce the amount of carbon dioxide and make\nwater healthy and fit for aquatic organisms. This treatment of waste water or sewage is\ncarried out in effluent treatment plants especially built for this purpose. The residue obtained\nfrom primary treatment one known as sludge.\n10.7.5 Water recycling\nWith increasing population the requirement for water is increasing rapidly . However , the\navailability of water is limited but an ever increasing water withdrawal from different sources Environmental Science Senior Secondary Course\nNotes\n176MODULE - 4\nContemporary\nEnvironmental Issues\nsuch as rivers, lakes and ground water is depleting these sources and deteriorating their\nwater quality . Therefore, it is essential to utilize the available water with maximum economy .\nThis involves recycling of waste water for certain uses with or without treatment. Recycling\nrefers to the use of waste-water by the original user prior to the discharge either to a\ntreatment system or to a receiving water body . Thus the waste water is recovered and\nrepetitively recycled with or without treatment by the same user .\n10.7.6. Control of water pollution\nThe following measures can be adopted to control water pollution:\n(a)The water requirement should be minimized by altering the techniques involved.\n(b)Water should be reused with or without treatment.\n(c)Recycling of water after treatment should be practiced to the maximum extent possible.\n(d)The quantity of waste water discharge should be minimized.\n INTEXT QUESTIONS 10.3\n1.Name the metals which when in excess in drinking water cause Minamata and Itai itai\ndiseases.\n______________________________________________________________\n2.When fertilizers and sewage enter a water body phytoplankton and algae grow rapidly .\nWhat is this phenomenon called.\n______________________________________________________________\n3.What is primary treatment?

Generally polluted water also pollute soil. Solid waste is a mixture of plastics,\ncloth, glass, metal and or ganic matter , sewage, sewage sludge, building debris, generated\nfrom households, commercial and industries establishments add to soil pollution. Fly ash,\niron and steel slag, medical and industrial wastes disposed on land are important sources\nof soil pollution. In addition, fertilizers and pesticides from agricultural use which reach soil\nas run-of f and land filling by municipal waste are growing cause of soil pollution. Acid rain\nand dry deposition of pollutants on land surface also contribute to soil pollution.\nFig. 10.3: A pile of plastic bags along with leftovers- a cow eating them\n10.8.1 Sources of soil pollution\nPlastic bags \u2013  Plastic bags made from low density polyethylene (LDPE), is virtually\nindestructible, create colossal environmental hazard. The discarded bags block drains and\nsewage systems. Leftover food, vegetable waste etc. on which cows and dogs feed may\ndie due to the choking by plastic bags. Plastic is non biodegradable  and burning of plastic\nin garbage dumps release highly toxic and poisonous gases like carbon monoxide, carbon\ndioxide, phosgene, dioxine and other poisonous chlorinated compounds.\nIndustrial sources \u2013  It includes fly ash, chemical residues, metallic and nuclear wastes.\nLarge number of industrial chemicals, dyes, acids, etc. find their way into the soil and are\nknown to create many health hazards including cancer .\nAgricultural sour ces \u2013 Agricultural chemicals especially fertilizers and pesticides pollute\nthe soil. Fertilizers in the run off water from these fields can cause eutrophication in water\nbodies. Pesticides are highly toxic chemicals which affect humans and other animals adversely\ncausing respiratory problems, cancer and death.\n10.8.2 Control of soil pollution\nIndiscriminate disposal of solid waste should be avoided.\n Environmental Science Senior Secondary Course\nNotes\n178MODULE - 4\nContemporary\nEnvironmental Issues\nTo control soil pollution, it is essential to stop the use of plastic bags and instead use bags\nof degradable materials like paper and cloth. Sewage should be treated properly before\nusing as fertilizer and as landfills. The organic matter from domestic, agricultural and other\nwaste should be segregated and subjected to vermicomposting which generates useful\nmanure as a by product. The industrial wastes prior to disposal should be properly treated\nfor removing hazardous materials. Biomedical waste should be separately collected and\nincinerated in proper incinerators.\n INTEXT QUESTIONS 10.4\n1.Define soil pollution.\n______________________________________________________________\n2.Why are plastic bags a big environmental nuisance?\n______________________________________________________________\n3.Vermicomposting degrades or ganic waste into a useful substance.

There are\nmany sources of radiation pollution such as nuclear wastes from nuclear power plants,\nmining and processing of nuclear material etc. The worse case of nuclear pollution was the\ncherndoyl disaster in Russia occured in 1986 but the ef fects still longer today .\n10.9.1 Radiation\nRadiation  is a form of energy travelling through space. The radiation emanating from the\ndecay of radioactive nuclides are a major sources of radiation pollution. Radiations  can be\ncategorized into two groups namely the non-ionizing radiations and the ionizing radiations.\nNon-ionizing radiations  are constituted by the electromagnetic waves at the longer\nwavelength of the spectrum ranging from near infra-red rays to radio waves. These waves\nhave energies enough to excite the atoms and molecules of the medium through which they\npass, causing them to vibrate faster but not strong enough to ionize them. In a microwave\noven the radiation causes water molecules in the cooking medium to vibrate faster and\nthus raising its temperature.\nIonizing radiations cause ionization of atoms and molecules of the medium through which\nthey pass. Electromagnetic radiations such as short wavelength ultra violet radiations (UV), 179Environmental Pollution\nNotesMODULE - 4\nContemporary\nEnvironmental IssuesX-rays and gamma rays and energetic particles produced in nuclear processes, electrically\ncharged particles like alpha and beta particles produced in radioactive decay and neutrons\nproduced in nuclear fission, are highly damaging to living organisms. Electrically charged\nparticles produced in the nuclear processes can have sufficient energy to knock electrons\nout of the atoms or molecules of the medium, thereby producing ions. The ions produced\nin water molecules, for example, can induce reactions that can break bonds in proteins\nand other important molecules. An example of this would be when a gamma ray passes\nthrough a cell, the water molecules near the DNA might be ionized and the ions might react\nwith the DNA causing it to break. They can also cause chemical changes by breaking the\nchemical bonds, which can damage living tissues. The ionizing radiations cause damage to\nbiological systems and are, therefore, pollutants.\n10.9.2 Radiation damage\nThe biological damage resulting from ionizing radiations is generally termed as  radiation\ndamage . Large amounts of radiation can kill cells that can dramatically affect the exposed\norganism as well as possibly its of fspring. Affected cells can mutate and result in cancer . A\nlarge enough dose of radiation can kill the organism.\nRadiation damage can be divided into two types: (a) somatic damage  (also called radiation\nsickness ) and (b) genetic damage. Somatic damage refers to damage to cells that are\nnot associated with reproduction. Effects of somatic radiation damage include reddening\nof the skin, loss of hair , ulceration, fibrosis of the lungs, the formation of holes in tissue, a\nreduction of white blood cells, and the induction of cataract in the eyes. This damage can\nalso result in cancer and death. Genetic damage refers to damage to cells associated with\nreproduction. This damage can subsequently cause genetic damage from gene mutation\nresulting in abnormalities. Genetic damages are passed on to next generation.\n10.9.3 Radiation dose\nThe biological damage caused by the radiation is determined by the intensity of radiation\nand duration of the exposure. It depends on the amount of energy deposited by the radiation\nin the biological system. In studying the effects of radiation exposure in humans , it is\nimportant to realize that the biological damage caused by a particle depends not only on\nthe total energy deposited but also on the rate of energy loss per unit distance traversed by\nthe particle (or \u201clinear energy transfer\u201d). For example, alpha particles do much more damage\nper unit energy deposited than do electrons.\nRadiation effects and radiation doses\nA traditional unit of human-equivalent dose is the rem, which stands for radiation  equivalen t\nin man.\nAt low doses, such as what we receive every day from background radiation (< 1 m rem),\nthe cells repair the damage rapidly . At higher  doses (up to 100 rem), the cells might Environmental Science Senior Secondary Course\nNotes\n180MODULE - 4\nContemporary\nEnvironmental Issues\nnot be able to repair the damage, and the cells may either be changed permanently\nor die. Cells changed permanently may go on to produce abnormal cells when\nthey divide and may become cancerous.\nAt even higher doses, the cells cannot be replaced fast enough and tissues fail to function.\nAn example of this would be \u201cradiation sickness.\u201d This is a condition that results after high\ndoses is given to the whole body (>100 rem).\nNuclear explosions and accidents in nuclear reactors are a serious source of radiation\nhazard. The effects of atomic explosions in Nagasaki and Hiroshima are still not forgotten.\nThe nuclear reactor accident at Chernobyl in 1986 led to deaths of many reactor personnel\nand a very large release of radionuclide to the environment causing a long term radiation\ndamage to the people living in the neighboring regions.\nAccidents at nuclear power plants\nNuclear fission in the reactor core produces lot of heat which if not controlled can\nlead to a meltdown of fuel rods in the reactor core. If a meltdown happens by\naccident, it will release large quantities of highly dangerous radioactive materials in\nthe environment with disastrous consequences to the humans, animals and plants.\nTo prevent this type of accidents and reactor blow up, the reactors are designed to\nhave a number of safety features.\nInspite of these safety measures two disasters in the nuclear power plants are\nnoteworthy- namely at \u2018Three Mile Island\u2019 in Middletown (U.S.A.) in 1979, at\nChernobyl (U.S.S.R.) in 1986. In both these cases a series of mishaps and errors\nresulted in over heating of the reactor core and lot of radiation was released into the\nenvironment. The leakage from Three Mile Island reactor was apparently low and\nno one was injured immediately . However , in case of Chernobyl the leakage was\nvery heavy causing death of some workers and radiation spread over large areas\nscattered all over Europe. People of the city had to be evacuated to safer places\nand the plant had to be closed down. These two disasters are a reminder that\nnuclear power reactors require a constant up gradation of safety measures. Accidents\nwith nuclear submarines also points to the same.\n INTEXT QUESTIONS 10.5\n1.Which type of radiations are produced in a microwave oven?\n______________________________________________________________\n2.State the use of absorbed dose of radiation.\n______________________________________________________________\n3.How much of radiation can damage internal organs upon its exposure for a few days.\n______________________________________________________________ 181Environmental Pollution\nNotesMODULE - 4\nContemporary\nEnvironmental Issues\n WHA T YOU HA VE LEARNT\n\u2022Nature\u2019 s components such as air , water , soil, forest and fisheries are resources exploited\nby humans and their pollution are by-product of urbanization and industrialization.\n\u2022Pollution in effect is an undesirable byproduct of industrialization and urbanization.\n\u2022The agents directly or indirectly responsible for the pollution of the environment are\nknown as pollutants.\n\u2022There are six types of pollutions: air pollution, water pollution, noise pollution, soil\npollution, thermal pollution, radiation pollution etc.\n\u2022Air pollution is a result of industrial and certain domestic activity .\n\u2022Air pollutants are of two types (1) suspended particulate matter , and (2) gases like\ncarbon dioxide CO2, NOx etc.\n\u2022Use of cleaner fuels such as biogas, CNG and electricity prevent air pollution.\n\u2022Segregation of waste, pretreatment at source, sterilization of rooms will help in checking\nindoor pollution.\n\u2022Prevention and control of industrial pollution can be reduced by using cleaner fuels,\nfilters, electrostatic precipitators, inertial collectors, scrubbers etc.\n\u2022Use of chlorofluorocarbons cause damage of ozone layer which has resulted in its\nthinning over the Arctic and Anctartic regions, is know as ozone hole.\n\u2022Increase in global temperature or heating effect by green house gases (CO2, methane)\nis known as green house effect.\n\u2022Noise like other pollution is a by product of industrialization, urbanization and modern\ncivilization.\n\u2022Indoor sources include noise produced by radio, television and outdoor source includes\nindiscriminate use of loudspeakers, industrial activities, automobile, rail traffic and\naeroplanes etc.\n\u2022Addition of undesirable substances in water is called water pollution.\n\u2022Natural sources of water pollution are soil erosion, leaching of minerals from rocks\nand decaying of or ganic matter .\n\u2022Power plants and various industries used lot of water for cooling purposes and hot\nwater is discharged into rivers, streams or oceans.
