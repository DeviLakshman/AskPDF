        "text": "Environmental Science Senior Secondary Course 164MODULE - 4 10 ENVIRONMENT AL POLLUTION Developmental activities such as construction, transportation and manufacturing not only deplete the natural resources but also produce large amount of wastes that leads to pollution of air , water , soil, and oceans; global warming and acid rains. Untreated or improperly treated waste is a major cause of pollution of rivers and environmental degradation causing ill health and loss of crop productivity . In this lesson you will study about the major causes of pollution, their effects on our environment and the various measures that can be taken to control such pollutions. OBJECTIVES After completing this lesson, you will be able to: define the terms pollution and pollutants; list various kinds of pollution; describe types of pollution, sour ces, harmful effects on human health and contr ol of air pollution, indoor air pollution, noise pollution; describe water pollution, its causes and contr ol; describe thermal pollution; describe soil pollution, its causes and contr ol; describe radiation pollution, sour ces and hazar ds. 10.1 POLLUTION AND POLLUT ANTS Human activities directly or indirectly af fect the environment adversely . A stone crusher adds a lot of suspended particulate matter and noise into the atmosphere. Automobiles emit from their tail pipes oxides of nitrogen, sulphur dioxide, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and a complex mixture of unburnt hydrocarbons and black soot which pollute the atmosphere. Domestic sewage and run off from agricultural fields, laden with pesticides 165Environmental Pollution Environmental Issuesand fertilizers, pollute water bodies. Effluents from tanneries contain many harmful chemicals and emit foul smell. These are only a few examples which show how human activities pollute the environment. Pollution may be defined as addition of undesirable material into the environment as a result of human activities. The agents which cause environmental pollution are called pollutants . A pollutants may be defined as a physical, chemical or biological substance unintentionally released into the environment which is directly or indirectly harmful to humans and other living organisms. 10.2 TYPES OF POLLUTION Pollution may be of the following types: Air pollution Noise pollution Water pollution Soil pollution Thermal pollution Radiation pollution 10.3 AIR POLLUTION Air pollution is a result of industrial and certain domestic activity . An ever increasing use of fossil fuels in power plants, industries, transportation, mining, construction of buildings, stone quarries had led to air pollution. Air pollution may be"

It is generally used for domestic waste Incineration lPrior to 1940, incineration was common in North America and western Europe. lMany incinerators were eliminated because of foul odors and gritty smoke lCurrently, about 15% of municipal solid waste is incinerated. Incineration Pros: Reduce volume 90%, weight 75% Heat from burning converted to electricityCons: Create air pollution Concentrates toxins in ash More costly than landfills, as long as space available Composting Harnessing natural decomposition to transform organic material into compost Materials such as plants, food scraps, and paper products can be decomposed into the organic matter. The organic matter that is produced from recycling can be agricultural uses. Usually this method of recycling is done by putting the materials in a container and let to stay there until it decomposes. Ocean dumping is the dumping or placing of materials in the ocean, often on the continental shelf. A wide range of materials is involved, including carbage construction and demolition debris, sewage sludge, dredge material, waste chemicals, and nuclear waste. Sometime hazardous and"

Nuclear waste : includes radioactive substances coming from reactors, fuel (uranium, thorium, plutonium etc). Its highly dangerous and requires proper disposal. Hazardous waste :includes toxic chemical, acids, corrosive, ignitable and reactive materials, gases etc.TYPES OF SOLID WASTE SOLID WASTE COMPOSITION Per capita waste generation increasing by 1.3% per annum With urban population increasing between 3 3.5% per annum Yearly increase in waste generation is around 5% annually India produces 42.0 million tons of municipal solid waste annually at present. Per capita generation of waste varies from 200 gm to 600 gm per capita / day. Collection efficiency ranges between 50% to 90% of the solid waste generated.MAGNITUDE OF PROBLEM 30% - 55% Compostable / Biodegradable Matter (can be converted into manure) 40% - 45% Inert material (to go to landfill) 5% - 10% Recyclable materials (Recycling) These percentages vary from city to city depending on food habitsMunicipal Solid Waste in India New Delhi : Capital of India HOSPITAL WASTES Non Infectious Infectious Non Sharps Sharps Solids Liquids Incinerable Non Incinerable (Autoclave, Microwave)Biodegradable Non Biodegradable COLOUR CODING COLOUR CODINGTYPE OF CONTAINERWASTE CATEGORYTREATMENT OPTIONS as per Schedule I Yellow Plastic Bag Cat.. 1, 2, 3 and 6Incineration / deep burial Red Disinfected container / Plastic BagCat. 3, 6, and 7 Autoclaving / Microwaving / Chemical Treatment Blue / White TranslucentPlastic Bag / puncture proof containerCat. 4, Cat. 7 Autoclaving / Microwaving / Chemical treatment and destruction shredding Black Plastic Bag Cat. 5, 9 and 10 (Solid)Disposal in secured landfill E-waste E-waste comprises of waste electronics goods which are not fit for their originally intended use.
